* In basidiomycota 1/25 GT dimers is a true donor

Kocim1
* We cut 33k intron candidates
* There are 19042 true introns on one strand and 13819 of them are in range 40-100
* There are 970 000 donor candidates -> frequency of true GTs is 20k/970k = 1/40 cca
* Random cuts 10k introns, gets 36 of them right. If we cut 33k, we would expect 100 right, which is cca 1% recall

Walic1
* We cut 26k intron candidates
* There are 6000 true introns on one strand and 5720 of them are in range 40-100
* There are 555 000 donor candidates -> frequency of true GTs is 5720/555k = 1/100 cca
* Random cuts 5542 introns, gets 11 of them right. If we cut 26k, we would expect 55 right, which is cca 1% recall
