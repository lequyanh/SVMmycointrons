* In basidiomycota 1/25 GT dimers is a true donor

Kocim1
* We cut 33k intron candidates
* There are 19042 true introns on one strand and 13819 of them are in range 40-100
* There are 970 000 donor candidates -> frequency of true GTs is 20k/970k = 1/40 cca
* Random cuts 2540 introns, gets 5 of them right. If we cut 33k, we would expect 80 right, which is >1% recall


Walic1
* We cut 26k intron candidates
* There are 6000 true introns on one strand and 5720 of them are in range 40-100
* There are 555 000 donor candidates -> frequency of true GTs is 5720/555k = 1/100 cca
* Random cuts 1400 introns, gets 2 of them right. If we cut 26k, we would expect 40 right, which is >1% recall
