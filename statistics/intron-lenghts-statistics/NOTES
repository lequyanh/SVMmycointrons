To generate the distribution of intron lengths, apply following steps:
    1. Create folder 'basi_introns_dataset'
        a) It will hold labeled intron datasets
        b) can be created by pairing splice site results with sufficiently large window, e.g. 200
        c) supply the list of fungi to script `intron_len.sh` a get the folder generated
    2. Create a text file with fungi, whose intron distributions you'd want to plot
        a) can be named anyway you want, but change it in the 'length_exploration.R' script
        b) can be created as
                `ls basi_introns_dataset | shuf | head -20 > fungi_list.txt `
